/** An %I2C Master, used for communicating with %I2C slave devices
 *
 * There are three different forms of the %I2C API usable via this class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Transaction-based %I2C</li>
 * <li>Single-byte %I2C</li>
 * <li>Asynchronous %I2C</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * All three of these APIs let you execute %I2C operations, but they work differently.
 *
 * <h1>Transaction-Based API</h1>
 *
 * The simplest API, which should be appropriate for most use cases, is the transaction-based API, which is
 * accessed through the \link I2C::read(int address, char *data, int length, bool repeated) read() \endlink and the
 * \link write(int address, const char *data, int length, bool repeated) write() \endlink functions.  These functions
 * execute an entire %I2C transaction (the start condition, address, data bytes, and stop condition) in a single
 * function call.
 *
 * The bytes to be read/written are passed in through an array, which requires that you can predict the
 * size of the data ahead of time.  If this information is not known, you may want to use the single-byte API instead
 * (see below).
 *
 * Example of using the transaction-based API to read the temperature from an LM75BD:
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 * I2C i2c(I2C_SDA , I2C_SCL);
 * const int addr7bit = 0x48;      // 7-bit I2C address
 * const int addr8bit = 0x48 << 1; // 8-bit I2C address, 0x90
 *
 * int main() {
 *     char cmd[2];
 *     while (1) {
 *         cmd[0] = 0x01;
 *         cmd[1] = 0x00;
 *
 *         // read and write takes the 8-bit version of the address.
 *         // set up configuration register (at 0x01)
 *         I2C::Result result = i2c.write(addr8bit, cmd, 2);
 *
 *         if(result != I2C::ACK)
 *         {
 *             // Chip not accessible, handle error....
 *         }
 *
 *         ThisThread::sleep_for(500);
 *
 *         // read temperature register
 *         cmd[0] = 0x00;
 *         i2c.write(addr8bit, cmd, 1, true); // Set repeated to true so that we don't give up the bus after this transaction
 *         i2c.read(addr8bit | 1, cmd, 2);
 *
 *         float tmp = (float((cmd[0]<<8)|cmd[1]) / 256.0);
 *         printf("Temp = %.2f\n", tmp);
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 *
 * <h1>Single-Byte API</h1>
 *
 * The single-byte API consists of the \link I2C::start() start() \endlink, \link I2C::write_byte() write_byte()
 * \endlink, \link I2C::read_byte() read_byte() \endlink, and \link I2C::stop() stop() \endlink functions.
 * With the single-byte API, you have manual control over each condition and data byte put onto the I2C bus.
 * This is useful for dealing with devices which can return variable amounts of data in one I2C operation,
 * or when you don't want to create buffers to store the data.  However, this API is more verbose than the
 * transaction-based API and will have a bit more overhead since there's more code executing per byte.
 *
 * The following is an example that accomplishes the same thing as the above code, but using the single-byte API.
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 * I2C i2c(I2C_SDA , I2C_SCL);
 * const int addr7bit = 0x48;      // 7-bit I2C address
 * const int addr8bit = 0x48 << 1; // 8-bit I2C address, 0x90
 *
 * int main() {
 *     while (1) {
 *         // read and write takes the 8-bit version of the address.
 *         // set up configuration register (at 0x01)
 *         i2c.lock();
 *         i2c.start();
 *         I2C::Result result = i2c.write_byte(addr8bit); // Write address, LSBit low to indicate write
 *         i2c.write_byte(0x01);
 *         i2c.write_byte(0x00);
 *         i2c.stop();
 *         i2c.unlock();
 *
 *         if(result != I2C::ACK)
 *         {
 *             // Chip not accessible, handle error....
 *         }
 *
 *         ThisThread::sleep_for(500);
 *
 *         // Set register to read
 *         i2c.lock();
 *         i2c.start();
 *         i2c.write_byte(addr8bit); // Write address
 *         i2c.write_byte(0x00);
 *         // To create a repeated start condition, we do not call stop() here
 *
 *         i2c.start();
 *         i2c.write_byte(addr8bit | 1); // Write address, LSBit high to indicate read
 *
 *         // Read the two byte temperature word
 *         uint16_t temperatureBinary = 0;
 *         temperatureBinary |= static_cast<uint16_t>(i2c.read_byte(true)) << 8;
 *         temperatureBinary |= static_cast<uint16_t>(i2c.read_byte(false)); // send NACK to indicate last byte
 *         i2c.stop();
 *         i2c.unlock();
 *
 *         float tmp = (float(temperatureBinary) / 256.0);
 *         printf("Temp = %.2f\n", tmp);
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * \attention If a single I2C object is being shared among multiple threads, you should surround usage of the
 * single-byte API with \link I2C::lock() lock() \endlink and \link I2C::unlock() unlock() \endlink.  This
 * ensures that a transaction by one thread is not interrupted by another.  It may also improve performance
 * because the backing mutex will not need to be locked for each byte.
 *
 * <h1>Asynchronous API</h1>
 *
 * The asynchronous API allows you to run %I2C operations in the background.  This API is only
 * available if your device has the I2C_ASYNCH feature.  To use this API, use \link I2C::transfer() transfer() \endlink
 * to start an operation and \link I2C::abort_transfer() abort_transfer() \endlink to stop it.  Alternately, use the
 * \link I2C::transfer_and_wait() transfer_and_wait() \endlink function to block the current thread until
 * the transfer finishes.
 *
 * Some devices implement these features using DMA, others use interrupts, so be mindful that there may still be
 * significant CPU usage if you have multiple and/or high-rate transfers going on.
 *
 * <h1>A Note about Addressing</h1>
 * Most %I2C devices make use of 7-bit addresses (see <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/addressing/">here</a> for details).
 * Mbed OS, however, works with addresses in 8-bit format, where the least significant bit specifies if the transaction
 * is a read (1) or a write (0).  Due to this, you will generally need to use bitshifts and bitwise ORs when passing
 * addresses to I2C functions.  See the documentation on each function for details.
 *
 * %I2C also has a <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/addressing/10-bit-addressing/">10-bit addressing mode</a>, where
 * the address is sent in two physical bytes on the bus.  Some, but not all, Mbed targets support this mode -- refer
 * to your MCU datasheet and your target's HAL code for details.  For 10-bit addresses, use the same format to
 * pass them to I2C functions -- shift them left by one and set the LSBit to indicate the read/write direction.
 * On MCUs that do not natively support 10-bit addressing, you can emulate support by using the single-byte API
 * to send two address bytes; see the linked page above for details.
 *
 * <h1>Other Info</h1>
 *
 * The I2C class is thread-safe, and uses a mutex to prevent multiple threads from using it at the same time.
 *
 * \warning Mbed OS requires that you only create one instance of the I2C class per physical %I2C bus on your chip.
 * This means that if you have multiple sensors connected together on a bus, you must create one I2C object at the
 * top level and pass it in to the drivers for each sensor.  Violating this directive will cause undefined
 * behavior in your code.
 *
 * \attention Due to how %I2C works, if multiple devices are sharing a bus which support different %I2C speeds, you cannot
 * go faster than the maximum bus speed of any of the devices.  Otherwise, slower devices may misinterpret messages
 * that are too fast for them and cause interference on the bus.  For example, if you have two 400kHz devices and one
 * 100kHz device on a bus, you must run the entire bus at 100kHz!
