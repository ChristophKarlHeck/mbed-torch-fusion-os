/**
 * @brief An %SPI Master, used for communicating with %SPI slave devices.
 *
 * The default format is set to 8-bits, mode 0, and a clock frequency of 1MHz.
 *
 * @note Synchronization level: Thread safe
 *
 * %SPI allows you to transfer data to and from peripheral devices using single-word transfers, transactions,
 * or an asynchronous API.
 *
 * Here's how to talk to a chip using the single-word API:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "mbed.h"
 *
 * SPI device(SPI_MOSI, SPI_MISO, SPI_SCLK, SPI_CS, use_gpio_ssel)
 *
 * int main() {
 *     device.format(8, 0);
 *
 *     device.lock();
 *     device.select();
 *     int response = device.write(0x0A);
 *     int response2 = device.write(0x0B);
 *     device.deselect();
 *     device.unlock();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * And here's how to do the same thing using a transaction:
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 *
 * SPI device(SPI_MOSI, SPI_MISO, SPI_SCLK, SPI_CS, use_gpio_ssel)
 *
 * int main() {
 *     device.format(8, 0);
 *
 *     uint8_t command[2] = {0x0A, 0x0B};
 *     uint8_t response[2];
 *     int result = device.write(command, sizeof(command), response, sizeof(response));
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * <h1>Hardware vs Software Chip Selects</h1>
 * <p>Most ARM chips have specific pins marked as "hardware chip selects".  This means that they are connected
 * to the %SPI peripheral and are automatically brought low by hardware when data is sent.  However, chips
 * often only have only one pin for each SPI bus that can be used as a hardware chip select.  If you wish to
 * use multiple peripheral devices with one SPI bus, or just don't have access to the HW CS pin, you must use the
 * %SPI object in "GPIO chip select" mode.</p>
 *
 * <p>To use GPIO CS mode, simply pass the CS pin as the 4th constructor parameter, then pass the
 * special constant \c use_gpio_ssel as the 5th parameter.  This puts the object in GPIO mode, where
 * it will operate the CS line as a regular GPIO pin before and after doing an SPI transfer.  This mode
 * is marginally slower than HW CS mode, but otherwise should offer the same functionality.  In fact,
 * since the pin mapping is more flexible, it may be advisable to use GPIO CS mode by default.</p>
 *
 * \warning It is not recommended to control the CS line using a separate DigitalOut instance!
 * This was needed in very old Mbed versions but should now be considered a legacy practice.
 * Not only does it make it difficult to use the asynchronous API, but it can also lead to corner
 * cases which corrupt data.  The CS line, whether done through GPIO or HW, should always be managed through
 * the SPI class.
 *
 * <h1>Sharing a Bus</h1>
 * <p>Multiple %SPI devices may share the same physical bus, so long as each has its own dedicated chip select
 * (CS) pin.  To implement this sharing, each chip's driver should create its own instance of the SPI class, passing
 * the same MOSI, MISO, and SCLK pins but a different CS pin.  Mbed OS will internally share the %SPI hardware
 * between these objects.  Note that this is <i>completely different</i> from how the I2C class handles
 * sharing.</p>
 *
 * <h1>Frame/Word Size</h1>
 * <p>Mbed OS supports configuration of the %SPI frame size, also known as the word size, which controls how
 * many bits are sent in one transfer operation (one call to SPI::write()).  This parameter should match
 * the "register size" of the %SPI peripheral that you are talking to.  For example, if you're working with a chip
 * which uses 16-bit registers, you should set the frame size to 16 using SPI::format().  Some Mbed devices also
 * support 32-bit frames -- use the \c DEVICE_SPI_32BIT_WORDS feature macro to test if yours does.</p>
 *
 * <p>The frame size controls the effective width of data written and read from the chip.  For example, if you set
 * frame size to 8, SPI::write(int) will take one byte and return one byte, but if you set it to 16, SPI::write(int)
 * will take a 16 bit value and return a 16 bit value. You can also do transactions with frame sizes other
 * than 8.  Just be sure to pass the length in bytes, not words!</p>
 *
 * <p>It should be noted that changing the frame size can perform an apparent "endian swap" on data being
 * transmitted.  For example, suppose you have the 32-bit integer 0x01020408.  On a little-endian processor,
 * this will be encoded with the LSByte <i>first</i> in memory: <tt>08 04 02 01</tt>.  If you send that
 * integer using one-byte word size, it will appear as such.  Consider the following example:</p>
 * @code{.cpp}
 * spi.format(8, 0);
 * uint32_t myInteger = 0x01020408;
 * spi.write(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(&myInteger), sizeof(myInteger), nullptr, 0);
 * @endcode
 *
 * <p>If you ran this code, then used a logic analyzer to view the bytes on the MOSI line, it would show bytes
 * matching the layout of the integer in memory:</p>
 * <pre>
 * MOSI -> 08 04 02 01
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>But what about if you used a 32-bit frame size?</p>
 * @code{.cpp}
 * spi.format(32, 0);
 * uint32_t myInteger = 0x01020408;
 * spi.write<uint32_t>(&myInteger, sizeof(myInteger), nullptr, 0);
 * @endcode
 *
 * <p>In this case, the complete 32-bit integer is sent as a single unit, from its MSBit to its LSBit, without
 * breaking it into bytes.  This will send the data in an order different from the order in memory.  Viewed as
 * bytes, it would look like:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * MOSI -> 01 02 04 08
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>But viewed by a peripheral chip which uses 32-bit SPI words, it would look like:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * MOSI -> 0x01020408
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>When viewed as bytes, it's almost as if you did an endian swap on the data before sending it,
 * but in fact it's standard %SPI behavior when using frame sizes greater than one byte.  This same rule
 * applies to receiving data, so be sure to check examples in the datasheet to determine what frame
 * size to use and whether byte swapping is needed when working with an external chip.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: Some Mbed targets support frame sizes that are not standard integer sizes, e.g. 4 bits, 7 bits, or
 * 24 bits.  However, the behavior of these frame sizes is not well defined and may differ across targets
 * or across API calls (e.g. single-byte vs transaction vs async).  More work is needed to make these consistent.</p>
 *
 * <h1>Asynchronous API</h1>
 * <p>On many processors, Mbed OS also supports asynchronous %SPI.  This feature allows you to run %SPI
 * transfers completely in the background, while other threads execute in the foreground.  This can
 * be extremely useful if you need to send large amounts of data over the %SPI bus but don't want to
 * block your main thread for ages.  To see if your processor supports async %SPI, look for the
 * DEVICE_SPI_ASYNCH macro.</p>
 *
 * <p>The asynchronous API has two different modes: nonblocking (where your thread can keep running, and
 * the transfer calls a callback when finished) and blocking (where your thread blocks for the duration of
 * the transfer but others can execute).  Here's a sample of how to send the same data as above
 * using the blocking async API:</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that when using the asynchronous API, you must use the CacheAlignedBuffer class when declaring the
 * receive buffer.  This is because some processors' async SPI implementations require the received buffer to
 * be at an address which is aligned to the processor cache line size.  CacheAlignedBuffer takes care of this
 * for you and provides functions (data(), begin(), end()) to access the underlying data in the buffer.</p>
 *
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 *
 * SPI device(SPI_MOSI, SPI_MISO, SPI_SCLK, SPI_CS, use_gpio_ssel)
 *
 * int main() {
 *     device.format(8, 0);
 *
 *     uint8_t command[2] = {0x0A, 0x0B};
 *     CacheAlignedBuffer<uint8_t, 2> response;
 *     int result = device.transfer_and_wait(command, sizeof(command), response, sizeof(command));
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * <p>This code will cause the data in \c command to be sent to the device and the response to be received into
 * \c response .  During the transfer, the current thread is paused, but other threads can execute.
 * The non-blocking API does not pause the current thread, but is a bit more complicated to use.
 * See the SPI::transfer_and_wait() implementation in SPI.cpp for an example.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Async: DMA vs Interrupts</h3>
 * <p>Some processors only provide asynchronous %SPI via interrupts, some only support DMA, and some offer both.
 * Using interrupts is simpler and generally doesn't require additional resources from the chip, however,
 * some CPU time will be spent servicing the interrupt while the transfer is running.  This can become very
 * performance-intensive -- on some chips, running async %SPI at frequencies of just a few MHz can be enough
 * to make the interrupt use 100% of CPU time.  In contrast, DMA can require additional resources to be allocated,
 * (e.g. chips with few DMA channels might only support DMA on one or two %SPI busses at a time), but
 * can run the bus at full speed without any CPU overhead.  Generally, DMA should be preferred if available,
 * especially if medium to fast bus speeds are needed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Consult your chip documentation and the Mbed port docs for your target to find out what is needed to enable
 * DMA support.  For example, for STMicro targets, see
 * <a href="https://github.com/mbed-ce/mbed-os/wiki/STM32-DMA-SPI-Support">here</a>.To select DMA or interrupts,
 * use the SPI::set_dma_usage() function.  By default, interrupt %SPI will be used unless you change the
 * setting.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Async: Queueing</h3>
 * <p>The async %SPI system supports an optional transaction queueing mechanism.  When this is enabled,
 * Mbed will allow multiple transactions to be queued up on a single bus, and will execute each one
 * and deliver the appropriate callback in series.  This is mainly useful for the non-blocking
 * async api (SPI::transfer()), though you can also use it with the blocking API by having multiple
 * threads call it at once.</p>
 *
 * <p>The transaction queue size defaults to 2 on most devices, but you can change that using the
 * \c drivers.spi_transaction_queue_len option, e.g.</p>
 * \code{.json}
 * {
 *     "target_overrides": {
 *          "*": {
 *              "drivers.spi_transaction_queue_len": 3
 *          }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * <p>To save a little bit of memory, you can also set the queue length to 0 to disable the queueing mechanism.</p>
 *
 * \warning Currently, the value set by SPI::set_default_write_value() is
 * <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/13941">not respected</a> by the asynchronous %SPI
 * code.  This needs to be fixed.
