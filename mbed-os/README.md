Arm Mbed OS is an open source embedded operating system designed specifically for the "things" in the Internet of Things. It includes all the features you need to develop a connected product based on an Arm Cortex-M microcontroller, including security, connectivity, an RTOS and drivers for sensors and I/O devices.

Mbed OS provides a platform that includes:

- Security foundations.
- Cloud management services.
- Drivers for sensors, I/O devices and connectivity.

This is Mbed OS Community Edition (CE), a fork focused on improving the build system and tooling, fixing bugs, and keeping maintenance going after ARM's step back from the Mbed project.
